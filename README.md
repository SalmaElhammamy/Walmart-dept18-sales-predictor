## ðŸš€ Model Comparison

We evaluated various forecasting approaches using RMSE on Deptâ€¯18â€™s test data:

| Category               | Best Model        | RMSE     | Notes                                                              |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Exponential Smoothing  | Holt Damped       | 5,106.67 | Captured slowing trend effectively.                                |
| ARIMA Family           | SARIMA            | 6,035.26 | Outperformed ARIMA & SARIMAX by modeling seasonality.              |
| Machine Learning       | Random Forest     | **1,678.54** | Best performanceâ€”captured weekly patterns via feature engineering. |
| Deep Learning          | LSTM              | 7,700.08 | Strongest among DLâ€”handled sequences well.                         |
| Automated Forecasting  | Prophet           | 14,367.80 | Fast but struggled with irregular seasonal spikes.                 |

## ðŸ§  Why Random Forest Won

Used lags (1â€“4 weeks), moving averages (4, 8, 12 weeks), holiday indicators, month/quarter/weekâ€‘ofâ€‘year, and trend index.  
These engineered features transform raw time series into structured inputs, enabling Random Forest to model complex, nonâ€‘linear patternsâ€”especially critical for capturing Deptâ€¯18's seasonal spikes, holiday surges, and trend shifts.
